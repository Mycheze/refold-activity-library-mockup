## What is the Activity Library?

A comprehensive library of language learning activities and techniques. Similar to a fitness app that explains techniques, such as "[What's a burpee?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2hv_NYhM-A)"

We want to help you improve your routine by showing exactly how to do each activity, when to use it, and what tools to try.

## How to use it

- **Search and filter** activities by phase, pillar, or skill
- **Read detailed guides** with setup instructions and troubleshooting
- **Watch videos** explaining concepts and demonstrations
- **Star activities** you use frequently for quick access
- **Explore recommended tools** that open in detailed tool pages

## Phases and Pillars

**7 Phases** replace our original 4 Stages ([video explanation](https://youtu.be/Jo4ds4mxuhU) | [written guides](https://refold.la/how-to-learn-spanish/)). They help you find activities appropriate for your current level.

**3 Pillars** ([video](https://youtu.be/jStLYOJL19U)) categorize all activities:
- **Interactive**: Using tools and focus to understand more than you normally could
- **Freeflow**: Relaxed immersion, understanding what you can naturally  
- **Priming**: Active study to prepare your brain for better immersion

A healthy routine balances all three pillars. Neglecting one means missing major gains!
