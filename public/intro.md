You are among the first people in the world to have access to our Activity Library. It's still in beta and we're working to improve it every day, so [your feedback](https://form.typeform.com/to/JvsO9bHi) is critical! On every page/section of the library, you'll see a little grey ! icon which you can click on to submit feedback. 

We'll read every bit of feedback and take it into account! Since this is a fast prototype, you may see your ideas implemented the very next day.

## What is the Activity Library?

We want to make a library of all the activities, techniques (and eventually) tools you might use during your language learning. It would function as a source of knowledge for learners to improve their language learning routine.

A lot of gyms or exercise apps do similar things! For example, a routine says "Do 10 Burpees" and you might think "What the heck is a Burpee??" And the app has a page describing what the exercise is and maybe has [a video like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2hv_NYhM-A).

## How to you use it?

You can sort and search for activities that you might do in your language learning. You can read about how to do them or watch explanation and demonstration videos. 

You can browse it whenever you'd like, save and refer back to frequent activities, or use it for inspiration on what new activity you should try next.

## What are the Phases and Pillars?

The **7 Phases** are our new model for the different phases of learning a language. They're very similar to the original 4 Stages in the [first version of the Refold Roadmap](https://refold.la/simplified/). But but Stages 2, 3 and 4 were converted into 2 phases each, giving us 7 rather than 4. 

To watch a video explaining the 7 Phases, [click here](https://youtu.be/Jo4ds4mxuhU). If you'd prefer to read about them, they're in [our free Learning Guides](https://refold.la/how-to-learn-spanish/).

The **3 Pillars** of immersion learning, if you prefer to watch a video about it, [click here](https://youtu.be/jStLYOJL19U). But the three pillars are: interactive immersion, freeflow immersion and priming. All immersion activities can be grouped into one of these three. 

**Interactive** immersion means that you're using tools and additional focus and brain power to push yourself to understand more of the language than you otherwise could. **Freeflow** is where you're just focusing on the content and letting the language slide through your brain, understanding as much as you can. And **priming** is when you do active study to prepare (or prime) your brain to understand more during your immersion activities.

A healthy learning routine has a solid mix of the three pillars. If you neglect one, you're missing out on potential massive gains!

You can sort the list of activities based on which Phases they *best* fit into and by the pillars the activities belong to.
