Reading along with matching audio (whether it's reading subtitles or audio plus transcript) and not stopping to look up any words or ponder the language. You just let the text and audio flow over you.	Strengthen knowledge you have;Match text with the sounds;Easier to understand than pure listening⏎⏎	Freeflow Reading with audio is a broad category of activities. But they all share the same core: you're reading something, while listening to it at the same time, and aren't stopping to look up or puzzle out new words or concepts.	Freeflow activites solidify knowledge you already have. However, it's not very efficient for learning new things. A good language routine includes freeflow, but prioritizes it more in the intermediate and advanced stages, when you have a lot more knowledge to solidify.	Many learners do too much freeflow in the beginner stages and become frustrated with their progress. It's easy to do a lot of freeflow, which feels like you're doing a lot of learning, but when your progress doesn't match, it's very frustrating. Make sure your freeflow is balanced with priming and interactive immersion.		All freeflow activities are different, so for a more specific guide, check a technique that falls into this category.		1;2;4;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/DcOrMOrvyFA	na	Category	Reading, Listening	Reading, Listening	Freeflow	#N/A				ASBplayer;Migaku;Language Reactor;LingQ;Lute;ReadLang			Activities
60202	VOCAB_STUDY	Vocab Study	- Flashcards⏎- Recognition cards⏎- Production cards⏎- Clozemaster⏎- Anki⏎- Goldlist⏎- SRS⏎- Drops⏎- Lingvist⏎- Memrise	Learning new or reviewing words and vocabulary.	Vocabulary is the base of learning any language. To reach fluency, you'll need to learn thousands of words! This category is for any time you're specifically studying and learning new words.	Learn to understand the language;Prepare yourself for immersion;Very easy to start and high impact on your ability	Vocab study can take a lot of different forms. You can learn with apps or your own flashcards or download decks from the internet.	Words are the foundation of language learning. You should prioritize vocab study at the beginning, but a good learning routine always includes new vocabulary in some way. But it should never be more than 25% of your total learning time.	It's easy to spend a lot of time learning words, so be sure to balance it with actual immersion activites.	Finding a tool you like for learning is important. We recommend Anki since it's customizable, incredibly powerful and free. Some people don't like it, however, so you may need to find your own favorite tool.		When you've found a tool, start by learning common words. A frequent mistake is that people will try to learn "basic" words or "themed" words. These are things like the days of the week, animal names or colors. These words will all eventually become useful, but you want to start by learning only the most common words that natives actually use. Look for the word "Frequency" or "Common words" when browsing vocab learning resources.⏎⏎Avoid overlearning the function words (small words like he, over, to). While these words ARE very common, they're actually so common, that it's best to let your brain learn them in context. They're often difficult to perfectly translate, anyway, so exposure to them will help you learn them better. Once you've seen their meaning a few times, don't worry about them too much. Spending your time on the content words will help you understand more, faster.⏎⏎When you know a word well, stop studying it! Many learners fall into the trap of relearning words they already know. Don't waste your valuable time on words you know.⏎⏎And finally, vocab study is only a small piece of the puzzle. You cannot memorize words and then expect to "know" them. You must activate your knowledge of words by finding and understanding them in real language. If you find yourself struggling to learn new words, the answer isn't to do more study, but to do more immersion.	1;2;3;4;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/NovSlKdJ2vo	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3TUh-n_xn4	Category	Study	Study	Priming	Language App; Flashcard creation				Anki;Memrise;Clozemaster;Lingvist			Activities
30103	TRANSCRIPTION	Transcription	- Dictation⏎- Scribe	Writing down exactly what you hear from audio.	Using audio (from any source) and writing down exactly what you hear. Ideally, you check your work against a transcript or with a native speaker, but that's optional.	Exceptional ear training;Force yourself to convert the spoken language into written language;See how real natives use the language	Transcription is pretty easy to understand how to do, even if it's very hard to actually do.	When you're focusing on your listening skills, a little daily transcription practice goes a long way. You don't need to spend more than 10-20 minutes on it to get a lot of benefit.	Checking your work can be very difficult if you don't have 100% matching text to verify with. Asking native speakers to verify clips that you transcribe is a good way to check your work.	To get started, you'll need: some audio and a way to listen to it, a way to write/type, patience and optionally, a correct text version to check your work against.	Once you have these things, listen to the audio a little bit to get into the mindset and flow. Focus on understanding and noticing the little words and way the speaker(s) are talking.⏎⏎Then, find a chunk you want to transcribe and listen to it a few times. For this reason, having a simple audio editing tool like Audacity for your listening can make it much more seamless. You don't need to use any of the features, but being able to visually see the waveform and select individual sections will make your life easier.⏎⏎Once you've listened to the section a few times, play it once more, then stop it and write down as much as you can. If the clip is long, don't worry. Do what you can. Now, repeat it again and fill in places you missed. If you need, put the audio on loop again and continue adding in and improving your transcription. ⏎⏎When you're happy with what you have written down, it's a good idea to check your work! Either verify with the official transcription, a native or ask an AI if your sentence makes sense for the spoken language (possibly prone to error, but better than nothing).⏎⏎If you're correct, move on to another section. If there are mistakes or differences, listen to the audio again, really focusing your ears on the things you missed. Sometimes, they're literally not there (but are implied by how the language works). Give yourself a pat on the back and move on.	Some tips:⏎- Use audio that's at an appropriate level and in a dialect you're familiar with⏎- If you hear a word you don't know, try your best to transcribe it anyway (then look it up)⏎- This takes practice! You will start VERY bad at it, but will improve quickly⏎- Start with shorter sections, but as you get more practice, try transcribing longer sentences⏎- Official transcriptions are often slightly different from the spoken language, so trust your instinct	3;5;7	https://youtu.be/E72ZBVQnxBQ	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPyYYQqbgc	Technique	Listening	Listening	Interactive		Interactive Listening;Ear Training			Audacity;Music Speed Changer			Activities

Giant paper dictionaries are a thing of the past. Popup dictionaries make word lookups easier: just select a word, press a key, and see its definition (and more).⏎⏎Using a popup dictionary lets you watch and understand content unavailable to learners a few decades ago. You're learning in the future!	Expand your abilities in the language;Train your ear to parse the language;Quickly verify and learn new things;Solidify knowledge learned from priming	Watching and reading means that you're watching some kind of video content (an internet video, TV show, movie) and reading along with matching subtitles. You can find matching subtitled content in lots of different places, but TV shows are the most common.	This kind of immersion is foundational to the early stages of the Refold method. You're able to make quick progress thanks to the text, while adapting your ears to the language. In the early stages of learning, this category should make up a bulk of your learning time, balanced with some priming and simple freeflow.	Interactive immersion in general can be intense and difficult. It might feel like your brain is melting. This is normal! But you should be prepared for it. Don't plan to do interactive immersion when you're exhausted after a long day. Find when you have the most learning energy and do it then.	To do this technique, you'll need a few things:⏎1. Video content that has matching subtitles⏎2. Selectable subtitles (read below)⏎3. A popup dictionary that supports your language⏎⏎Item 2, Selectable subtitles, means that you need to be able to interact with the subtitles. Many websites don't have their subtitles rendered as text, which means you can't copy them. To test if this is the case for you, open the video you want to watch and turn on subtitles. Can you select the text and copy it? Or does it not act like regular text on a webpage? If you can copy it, great! But if you can't, you'll need to use something that allows you to do that, or else you won't be able to use the popup dictionary. The best tool for this is ASBplayer.	Once you have your video, selectable subtitles and popup dictionary, all you need to do is watch! Whenever you see an interesting word or can't understand a sentence, pause the video and look up a few words. If the sentence has more than 3–4 words you don't know, feel free to move on. The goal isn't to understand every sentence. You want to focus on the low hanging fruit.⏎⏎The lower your level in the language, the more you'll pause. That's okay. It might take you 5× the length of the content to actually get through it. But you're learning, that's the point.⏎⏎If you're using a program to make the subtitles selectable, many of them have "auto-pause" features, which automatically pauses after each subtitle line, giving you time to look up words. We recommend you use this since it forces you to focus more on understanding, rather than just zoning out and watching the pretty colors go by.⏎⏎It's also a good idea to rewatch a scene or a few lines after you successfully understand, since that gives your brain a good chance to really understand it, in real time.	The core "loop" of watching and reading with a popup dictionary is this:⏎- You watch a sentence/line and read the subtitles⏎- You pause and look up a few unknown words with the dictionary⏎- You try to understand what the sentence means⏎- You rewatch the section to review the spoken version and solidify it in your mind⏎- Repeat!	1;2;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/GFqtT8sm2zA	https://youtu.be/XYvGjlWnd3w	Technique	Watching, Reading, Listening	Watching, Reading, Listening	Interactive		Interactive Reading + Listening						Activities
10103	SENTENCE_MINING_TEXT_AUDIO	Sentence Mining	- Mining⏎- Card creation⏎- Migaku⏎- Anki	Watching something and saving new words from the subtitles.	Sentence mining is saving words or phrases from target-language content for later review. Videos, shows, or movies are especially powerful for mining because you learn words in context from content you enjoy, often with audio and images for more engaging reviews.	Expand your abilities in the language;Train your ear to parse the language;Quickly verify and learn new things;Solidify knowledge learned from priming;Make personalized vocab cards to learn from	Sentence mining is a very powerful technique for understanding more of the language and learning more vocabulary. Once you get everything set up and learn the workflow, it might become your favorite activity.	Sentence mining (reading plus listening) is the best way to find new vocabulary to learn in the beginner and early intermediate stages. It's a fantastic form of interactive immersion, which should make up the majority of your learning time. It's great for learning new words, reviewing ones you've already learned, and practicing understanding sentences and following a story.	Interactive immersion in general can be intense and difficult. It might feel like your brain is melting. This is normal! But you should be prepared for it. Don't plan to do interactive immersion when you're exhausted after a long day. Find when you have the most learning energy and do it then.	You'll first need to set up tools in order to sentence mine.	Once you've done that, here's how to do the technique:⏎⏎Whenever you see an interesting word or can't understand a sentence, pause the video and look up a few words. If the sentence has more than 3–4 words you don't know, feel free to move on. The goal isn't to understand every sentence. You want to focus on the low hanging fruit.⏎⏎The lower your level in the language, the more you'll pause. That's okay. It might take you 5× the length of the content to actually get through it. But you're learning, that's the point.⏎⏎Anyway, whenever you come across a sentence that has only 1 or 2 new words in it, this is a great time to mine! You don't want to mine sentences that have 5–6 new things in them. That sentence is too complicated for now. You'll be able to understand it with time.⏎⏎When you've found a good sentence, use the tool to mine the sentence! This usually involves selecting the sentence and pressing a button or using a keyboard shortcut. Great job! You just mined a sentence.⏎⏎Many sentence mining tools have "auto-pause" features, which automatically pauses after each subtitle line, giving you time to look up words. We recommend you use this since it forces you to focus more on understanding, rather than just zoning out and watching the pretty colors go by.⏎⏎It's also a good idea to rewatch a scene or a few lines after you successfully understand, since that gives your brain a good chance to really understand it, in real time.⏎⏎The core "loop" of sentence mining is this:⏎- You watch a sentence/line and read the subtitles⏎- You pause and look up 1–2 unknown words with the dictionary⏎- You try to understand what the sentence means⏎- You save the sentence to your flashcards for review later⏎- You rewatch the section to review the spoken version and solidify it in your mind⏎- Repeat!⏎⏎After your sentence mining session, you'll have a bunch of new flashcards to study! You should study these during your normal flashcard review time, ideally a day or two after you mined them, so they're still a little fresh in your mind.	Tip: It's very easy to mine a TON of cards! Way more than you need or can study at the time. For this reason, we recommend removing or deleting cards that you don't need. For example, if you're reviewing new words and you realize that one of the words is very niche or the card is a bit broken, delete that card! If that word is important, it'll come up again and you can mine it then.⏎⏎Same goes for if you have too many new cards. If you realize that you're not reviewing new cards you recently made (since you created a large backlog), feel free to delete some of the older ones. It's better to review the words that are more relevant to the content you're currently immersing in.	2;6;7	https://youtu.be/xDrknEHjYuQ	https://youtu.be/SvZVVSuhG18	Technique	Reading, Listening, Watching	Reading, Listening, Watching	Interactive		Interactive Reading + Listening			Migaku;ASBplayer;Kimchi Reader;LingoPie;Yomitan;AnkiConnect			Activities

But they all share the same core: you're reading something (without any audio) and are stopping to look up or puzzle out new words or concepts.	Interactive reading (without any audio) is a great activity to do, but isn't recommended for beginners. The lack of audio means that you're not connecting the spoken and written language, and purely text based content tends to be more difficult.⏎⏎If you're a big fan of reading and want to do pure interactive reading earlier in the process, look for graded readers or reread translations of favorite stories you already know!⏎⏎Once you're in the more intermediate and advanced stages, incorporating reading into your routine is excellent for improving and exapanding your vocabulary.	Picking appropriate content is the hardest part of reading, at every level. Don't be afraid to try out different sources for your reading material.

But they all share the same core: you're reading something (without any audio), and aren't stopping to look up or puzzle out new words or concepts. You just keep on reading.	In the intermediate and advanced stages, freeflow reading is one of the easiest and best kinds of activities you can do for your learning. It shouldn't be all of your time, but reading is excellent for reviewing and solidifying vocabulary as well as getting exposure to new words or phrases.⏎⏎Freeflow reading is best done with content that is slightly above your level, something where you know above 95% of the words. For intermediate learners, this might mean young adult books or graphic novels. And more advanced learners should look for articles or books they already know.	Actually being able to read without tools takes a long time and a lot of words. If you try to do it too early, it might be very frustrating or overwhelming. Keep focused on interactive reading and priming, and with time, you'll be able to freeflow read without problems.

20105	READING_ALOUD_UNCORRECTED	Uncorrected Reading Aloud		Reading aloud to practice pronunciation and flow.	Reading aloud from a text without getting any feedback from a native or anyone. You just read aloud and do your best. You can record yourself for reviewing after the fact, but that's optional.	Easy way to practice pronunciation, rhythm and flow;Ensure you're practicing with correct language;Train your clarity when speaking	This activity is more or less what it says on the tin. You find some text in your target language and read it aloud.	Reading aloud never needs to be a massive portion of your output plan, but it is very helpful for building a habit, since it's so easy to start. It's not a required activity, but if you're struggling to do enough output, try 15 minutes of reading aloud per day for a few weeks.		This is easiest with a book or a piece of longer form writing, but you could do it with anything. If you want to practice reading aloud numbers or names, you could use a Wikipedia article with lots of those in it. If you want to practice your reading accuracy, a book is more useful. Or if you want to have something interesting to talk about in your next lesson, finding a news article can work great.	Since you're not doing any correction with your reading aloud, just read! If you feel like you say something wrong, stop and repeat the line or word. Even redoing an entire paragraph can help you feel more confident. ⏎⏎You could record your reading aloud for later analysis (Speaking Analysis), which could be very useful. But it's not required to get a little reading aloud practice in.	Reading aloud is a skill (beyond the speaking part), so don't be worried if it's very hard at first. With just a little bit of practice, you'll get better quickly! Doing even 10–15 minutes of reading aloud per day can help you feel more confident in your accent and word choice. ⏎⏎Bonus tip: Read aloud something you wrote in your target language (ideally that's been corrected with a teacher). That way, you get practice saying things in your own words!	4;6;7	https://youtu.be/eEZkwUB284Q	https://youtu.be/HlR2DXl4nMQ	Technique	Speaking, Reading	Speaking, Reading	Interactive		Speaking Practice						Activities

But they all share the same core: you're listening to something (without any text) and are stopping to look up or puzzle out new words or concepts. Interactive Listening is best done with tools or by using subtitles to help you quickly verify what you heard.	Interactive listening (without any text) is a great activity to do, but isn't recommended for beginners. The lack of text makes it a lot harder to follow along with the content and understand enough of the language.⏎⏎Once you're in the listening stages of learning, you should be doing as much interactive listening as possible! Listening is a very hard skill to develop, but with the right interactive techniques, you'll surprise even yourself!	Interactive immersion in general can be intense and difficult. It might feel like your brain is melting. This is normal! But you should be prepared for it. Don't plan to do interactive immersion when you're exhausted after a long day.

This is the best way to get in massive amounts of immersion, since you don't need to do much. However, make sure that you're understanding enough, or else you might not make the progress you're hoping for!	Strengthen knowledge you have;Learn new words through exposure;Easy to spend lots of time with the language	Freeflow Listening is a broad category of activities. But they all share the same core: you're listening to or watching something (without any text), and aren't stopping to look up or puzzle out new words or concepts. You just keep on listening. Once you're at a good enough level to be able to do this and understand a lot, it's the easiest way to get a massive amount of exposure to the language.	When you're able to understand 80%+ of content, just from listening, it's a good idea to start incorporating it into your routine. It's easy to do a lot of freeflow listening, since you can do it while doing other things (walking, cleaning, laying down and just staring at the ceiling), or even do it while tired. Advanced learners get the most benefit from freeflow listening, but starting to practice the skill in the intermediate stages is a good idea.	Many learners do too much freeflow in the beginner stages and become frustrated with their progress. It's easy to do a lot of freeflow, which feels like you're doing a lot of learning, but when your progress doesn't match, it's very frustrating. This is especially true with pure audio freeflow, since it's very hard to understand and follow the plot if you can't pick out at least 80% of the words. To get to that point, make sure your freeflow is balanced with priming and interactive immersion.

30107	LISTEN_LOOPING	Listen Looping	- Interactive listening⏎- Intensive Listening⏎- Listening w/ Lookups⏎- Corrected Listening	Using audio software to listen repeatedly to difficult sections.	Listen looping is a simple activity that can help you to understand way more than you thought you could. All you need is a way to listen to sections of audio over and over again (hence the name looping). When you find sections you think you might be able to understand, looping them a few times can reveal the meaning!	Train your ears to hear things you know;Adapt your listening to real speech;Uncover new parts of the spoken language	This a simple activity which trains your ears to hear better!	When you're focusing on your listening skills, a little daily listen looping goes a long way. You don't need to spend more than 10-20 minutes on it to get a lot of benefit.	Listen looping is only really possible with a special audio editing tool. These tools usually have a learning curve and are a bit clunky. If you find yourself frustrated with the software, take a break and try again in a few minutes or the following day.	To do listen looping, you'll need some kind of audio editing tool. Audacity is recommended since it's free, but anything works. You don't need any of the editing features, it's just nice to be able to easily select and loop sections of the audio, which is hard with a regular mp3 player.	To start, load in an audio clip. It can be anything, but downloading a podcast or YouTube video or even audiobook can all work. Really long files will take longer to load, so keep that in mind.⏎⏎Start listening to the file and take a minute or two to focus on what the speaker is saying and get into the rhythm. Then, start listening for sections that you don't understand, but that you think you might be able to. If you clearly hear a bunch of words you don't know, skip that. We want to find a bit that's hard to hear because it's too fast, or the words are mushed together or something like that.⏎⏎When you find a section like that, select it and play it a few times. If your audio tool has a loop function, you can put the section on loop so you hear it over and over again. Try your best to really hear what's being said. If you want, you can make this into a transcription exercise and write down what you hear.⏎⏎Repeat the section a few times to see if you can hear exactly what's being said. When you get it, move on! The goal here is to give your brain and ears time to hone in on how things are being said by real speakers.	Optionally (and if you have this available to you), you can check a transcription to make sure you were correct.	3;4;6	https://youtu.be/g6B4JWAGpaM	https://youtu.be/e2vPjk9odPU	Technique	Listening	Listening	Interactive		Interactive Listening;Ear Training			Audacity;Music Speed Changer			Activities
20201	ALPHABET_STUDY	Alphabet Study	- Script⏎- Script study⏎- Kana⏎- Pinyin⏎- Syllabary⏎- Abjad⏎- Writing system⏎- Phonetic writing system⏎- Study	Practicing, training or learning the alphabet* of your new language.	When learning a language with a new writing system (alphabet, syllabary, abjad, etc.), mastering the basics is key. Being able to read opens up the world of text and boosts learning effectiveness. Prioritize this early, then focus on reading practice to deepen your mastery.	Unlock the power of reading;Doesn't take much effort to make progress	There are many different ways to study a new language's alphabet (or other writing system). Typically, you'll find the best resources from long-time teachers of those languages who have helped hundreds of students to learn to read. Do some searching for apps, websites or even books that teach the writing system, try a few of them out, then pick your favorite.	You should only be doing alphabet study in the very beginning of your journey. It's to give you a base for your reading, but if you want to get good at reading, more study isn't the answer. More reading is! Study the basics of the writing system and practice using it. After a few days or weeks, you won't need to do this activity any more.	NOTE: If you're learning a language with characters (like Mandarin, Korean or Cantonese), this activity is not for you. There's a "character study" activity. However, if you're learning a system like Pinyin or Kana, that would be considered alphabet study.	The tool that you use to read isn't a critical decision point, you just need the basics, then lots of practice, which will come during your immersion.⏎⏎Do 10–20 minutes of alphabet study per day with your chosen tool until you're at least comfortable reading words (slowly) in the new language.		A few tips for alphabet study:⏎- If you're struggling to remember the sounds letters make, little mnemonics can help a lot!⏎- Don't try to memorize all the rules, especially if they seem pretty arbitrary. Your brain will learn to recognize the patterns from exposure, not memorization.⏎- Be consistent with your study, but don't try to overload yourself. 10 minutes per day for a few weeks is a better approach than trying to do it all in 1 day.⏎- Don't be too hard on yourself if you're a very slow reader. Learning to process new representations of a language is hard!	1	https://youtu.be/Yjt7dCTPZwc	https://youtu.be/Mq64SzschXY	Category	Study	Study	Priming	#N/A							Activities
30201	EAR_TRAINING	Ear training	- Sound priming⏎- Audio priming⏎- Sound study⏎- Sound preparation⏎- Audio preparation⏎- Phonology study⏎- Minimal Pairs⏎- Tones⏎- Pitch	Doing exercises to improve your ability to hear the language.	Every language has its own set of sounds, like a spoken alphabet. Your new language likely has sounds not in your native one. Our brains learn to ignore unfamiliar sounds, so you may struggle to hear new ones accurately. With practice, you can retrain your ears, improving listening skills and your accent and speech.	Train your ears to hear new sounds;Improve your listening and speaking	Ear training is a broad category of various techniques which all have to do with training your ears to better hear the language. A common example of ear training is "minimal pairs training" where you practice distinguishing between two very similar sounds that don't exist in your native language.	A little bit of ear training goes a long way. It can be done at different points in the learning process, but ideally you start doing it from the beginning. Training your ears early in the process helps avoid having to relearn things later.⏎⏎For languages that have very different sound systems from your native one, doing a solid 15-20 minutes of ear training per day for a few weeks can be really beneficial. But if your target language has a sound system that isn't too different, watching a few videos or doing a few minutes of training per day is more than enough to get the benefits.	Our brains literally learn to ignore sounds that aren't important for our native language. This means that there may be sounds you cannot hear the difference between. Trust the resources over your own ears and with time, you'll learn to distinguish them.⏎⏎Age plays a role in learning new sounds. It doesn't mean you're doomed to never being able to hear the sounds of your target language if you're over 40, but it does mean you'll need to pay special attention and do more practice than a teenager (damn kids).		Specific ear training methods vary between different languages and learning styles. Some methods/tools to look into are Fluent Forever, The Mimic Method, Tone Training, Minimal Pairs, or check out the Sound Study activity.		1;3;4;7	https://youtu.be/nwm16Hck8gk	https://youtu.be/7T_UTaDZ7WQ	Category	Study, Listening	Study, Listening	Priming	Transcription; Listen Looping; Sound study	Sound study						Activities
40101	ASSISTED_WRITING	Assisted writing	- Corrected writing⏎- Intensive writing⏎- Interactive writing	Using tools while writing in your target language (like a dictionary).	Writing is tough (even in your native language) but practice makes you better. Writing in your target language improves grammar awareness and helps you express yourself clearly. "Assisted" writing uses tools like dictionaries, while writing without tools is called "unassisted."	Convert words you passively know into more active knowledge;Force yourself to think more slowly and methodically about the language;Train yourself to express your thoughts better	Just write! The more, the better. Assisted writing means that you're using tools to help you learn to write better. This means using a dictionary to find the right word or double-checking what grammar makes the most sense. But sometimes that's easier said than done.	Writing is best incorporated into your routine after speaking. Before you start writing a lot, you want to feel reasonably comfortable having a conversation. Before that, you'll likely overthink writing too much and become frustrated at the amount of errors and difficulty. ⏎⏎When you do start writing, though, it's an excellent way to put your brain into output mode and get a lot of good practice with the language. 20-40 minutes of writing per day goes a long way.	Before you start writing, you might find it helpful to do some Typing Practice or Handwriting Practice, so that you're not slowed down too much by your tools.	Find yourself a quiet and mostly distraction-free place to write, whether it's by hand or on a computer (or even your phone!). Remove as many distractions as you can and open a notepad. It's also worth choosing your writing tools beforehand (a good dictionary or site or even AI chatbot).	Then just start writing. It can be about whatever! The goal of assisted writing is to stretch yourself to write more and better than you could without any tools. So looking up words is a good thing. Or when you find a sentence that's hard for you to express, do your best then ask a chatbot to help you correct it. There's plenty of little things you can do to assist in your writing, so it's best to try a bunch of things and see what works for you.⏎⏎You can write a journal entry about your day, plan what you're going to do on the weekend, or complain about something in your life that's bothering you. If you're new at writing, it's a lot harder, but you'll get better with time.	Here are a few more tips:⏎- If you don't know how to type, check out Typing Practice (same goes for Handwriting Practice)!⏎- If you'd like to share your writing with others, making a simple (free) blog on Bearblog is a good choice, or Journaly is a multilingual mini blogging platform.⏎- Once you're in the flow of writing like this, you can work on writing a bigger "piece" over a longer period of time. Something like that makes for excellent material to bring to a class!⏎- When you find a new word or grammar pattern that you're struggling with, you can "mine" that and save it to Anki to review later	4;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/jgwVOADQl9E	https://youtu.be/mpRyX_NqWE0	Category	Writing	Writing	Interactive	#N/A							Activities

Analyzing your writing helps identify mistakes and areas to improve, benefiting your overall language skills. You can analyze by self-editing, reviewing with a tutor, or using AI tools. Reflecting on and correcting mistakes boosts your language abilities.	Learn from your own mistakes;Find areas for further improvement	Analyzing your own writing is a fantastic way to improve and learn from your mistakes.	When you're trying to improve your output, getting corrections is critical! It can be overwhelming or emotionally heavy to be told where you're WRONG, but knowing what you can improve and seeing what would sound better/more natural is incredibly important for growth. After you've built baseline comfort in both your speaking and writing, start to incorporate a lot of analysis into your routine.	The most common issue is that taking corrections and analyzing your mistakes can be difficult. Being told where you're wrong can hurt! So go into this activity with improvement in mind and know that you already do so many things well. If you were actually terrible, fixing and improving individual mistakes wouldn't be worth it.⏎⏎Another issue that can come up is getting conflicting or overzealous feedback. Languages aren't math. There often isn't a single correct answer. If you are given a correction, it might be a personal preference, or part of a specific dialect, or only used in formal texts. There's a lot to keep in mind about corrections, so don't assume that there's always a right and wrong answer.		There are lots of different activities that would fall under "writing analysis," which will all vary slightly in how they look. Here are some tips:⏎- Simply rereading your own text and looking out for mistakes is great and easy to do! This kind of analysis helps you practice finding your own mistakes⏎- You can also do it during a lesson, with a tutor. Hearing their feedback, live, is an excellent way to dig into what you said that was incorrect and also verify that your writing makes sense⏎- AI writing correctors are also very good options, since they can be free and available any time of day.

50101	CROSSTALK	Crosstalk	- Conversation⏎- Partner	Speaking with a partner, but each uses their native language.	Conversation requires two skills: speaking and understanding. It's easier to practice one at a time, starting with understanding. Crosstalk lets each person speak their native language, so you focus fully on comprehension, then respond comfortably in your own language. Ideal prep for real conversations.	Learn to have a conversation in a low-stress environment;Make friends in the language, even with a low level;Have deeper conversations than possible if only in the target language	Crosstalk is easy enough to understand, but takes a little getting used to. It's like a normal conversation, but you speak in your native language and understand in your target language (and your partner does the same).	Crosstalk is able to be done at any point in the learning process, from total beginner to very advanced! But it's most useful in the listening stage and as a way to make deeper connections with friends or relatives in your target language.	Convincing other people to try crosstalk can be a bit of a challenge, since most people don't know what it is. And when you do start crosstalking with someone, it can be hard to stay in separate languages. But gently remind them which language to speak in.	In crosstalk, you're having a normal conversation, but you are speaking in a different language than your speaking partner. You should both speak languages you're very comfortable with. So if you're a native English speaker learning Spanish, you would speak English and your partner would speak Spanish.	Crosstalk is a listening exercise, not exactly a speaking one. But it does help you lead up to speaking. The goal of crosstalk is to master the receptive side of a conversation. It's an excellent way to practice your understanding with a real person, who talks at a normal speed, directly to you.⏎⏎You can start having really fun and interesting crosstalk conversations very early in the learning process! Since you're able to express your thoughts easily, you can focus entirely on understanding the other person.	Look for native speakers of your target language who are learning your mother tounge. That's the best way to find willing crosstalk partners, and you might make a friend!⏎⏎Crosstalk can also be very helpful for family communication. If your partner or family speaks your target language and not much of your native language, it's often much easier to jump into crosstalk than into full on conversations in one language.	1;2;3;4	https://youtu.be/QD9x_gnFnyg	https://youtu.be/f-imnKleqBw	Technique	Listening	Listening	Interactive		Speaking Practice;Interactive Listening						Activities

If you only practice speaking with a partner, you're missing out! Not only do you always need to find someone to talk to, you're only speaking for (around) 1/2 the time. But when you speak on your own, you can really let your thoughts fly. This can be something like talking to yourself or recording yourself for later analysis.	Easy to do with very little setup;Best way to get a lot of speaking practice;Train your comfort speaking aloud in a low-stress environment	There are many different ways to do "speaking alone," but they're all pretty simple. You just need to speak... alone!	When you're trying to improve your speaking, consistancy and momentum are very helpful. But scheduling a tutoring session every day can be time intensive, energy consuming and expensive! Speaking on your own can help you keep the daily momentum and give you a great place to practice without anyone else judging you. Speaking alone activities are great to work into your routine anytime in the output process.	The hardest part for most people is figuring out what to talk about! Talking about your day, any plans you have or random topics is great. But if you find your mind going blank, combine speaking with your input! Talk about something you're watching or reading in your target language and try to use words from those materials.		A few of the best ways to do this are:⏎- Video log (vlog). Set up a camera and record yourself speaking for 5–10 minutes. You don't need to publish it or anything, but having the recording can be really helpful for Speaking Analysis⏎- Narration. If you don't know what to talk about, you can narrate what you're doing in real time! Say what actions you're doing, what thoughts come to mind, anything! You may look a little crazy, but it's great practice⏎- Reacting. When you're watching a movie or video or something, you can react (aloud) and say what you see, what you think or really anything. The idea isn't to really watch whatever it is you have on, but to use it as inspiration of what to talk about		4;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/l-OhftySJYc	https://youtu.be/tWWsylxCGAU	Category	Speaking	Speaking	Freeflow	#N/A							Activities

50201	CHORUSING	Chorusing	- Karaoke⏎- Parroting⏎- Repeating⏎- Shadowing⏎- Call and response⏎- Mimic	Using a tool to repeatedly listen and repeat an audio clip.	Chorusing is a slightly strange, but very useful technique for practicing pronunciation, rhythm, common phrases and more. The gist is that you take an audio clip and repeat along with it, many times in a row, until you sound very similar! You can even record your voice and analyze it after to find areas for improvement.	Train listening, pronunciation, prosody and tone all at once;Effective in small amounts;Great for training sentence chunks	Chorusing is one of the best activities you can do for improving your speaking and listening. It's incredibly powerful, but a bit of a task to set up. Chorusing is the act of taking an audio clip (somewhere between 3 and 15 seconds) and repeating it over and over until you can say it just like the native speaker.	As you're preparing to start speaking and/or while working on your listening, chorusing is immensely beneficial. It's also great to continue doing as you build an output routine. Once you're established and feel confident with output, it loses some of its potential, but can still be a great way to learn new things and improve your naturalness.	The most common issue is that chorusing is really difficult! There are tools to set up, workflows to learn and you need to find audio. But once you get used to the process, it gets easier!	In order to do chorusing, you're going to need some kind of audio interface tool, such as Audacity. You'll also need audio to work with and headphones. Optionally, you can use a microphone to hear what you sound like and record yourself for comparison.	How to chorus:⏎1. Load your audio file into the audio tool⏎2. Listen to it normally for a bit, and find a sentence or a chunk that you want to chorus⏎3. Select that section and (if you want) move it to its own track or section so it's easier to keep track of⏎4. Play the clip several times, listening to the way the speaker says everything⏎5. Put the clip on loop (so it repeats) and try to start speaking along with it⏎6. (Optional) Record yourself doing the clip a few times and then listen to yourself in comparison to the original⏎7. Do a final few tries until you feel comfortable saying the clip, then move on! Good work!	Tips:⏎- If you're struggling with a specific section, select that part and try to get it just right, then continue with the whole clip⏎- If it's too fast, reducing the tempo to ~85% can be helpful, but once you can do it at that speed, try speeding it back up⏎- If the audio is distracting, try doing it without listening to the audio a few times. That can help you get into the groove⏎- If you're really struggling with the words, try writing out exactly what they say (Transcription), it can help a lot!⏎- Chorusing is hard, but once you get into the rhythm and learn how the tools work, it becomes a really powerful activity, so don't give up!	3;4;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/p_DcwTpp6GE	https://youtu.be/0i9BExdOYDs	Technique	Listening, Speaking	Listening, Speaking	Interactive		Speaking Practice;Interactive Listening			Audacity;Music Speed Changer			Activities
50202	SHADOWING	Shadowing	- Karaoke⏎- Parroting⏎- Repeating⏎- Freeflow repetition⏎- Mimic	Repeating along with audio in real time, no stopping.	You are like the shadow that is following another speaker in the language. Using audio, you repeat after the speaker a fraction of a second after they do, trying to maintain the same rhythm, tone and everything they say for as long as possible. Shadowing is very difficult, so it's best to start with Chorusing!	Train listening, pronunciation, prosody and tone all at once;Great for training your focus in the language;Learn to speak the way a native does	Shadowing is a useful but difficult skill for improving your speech naturalness and awareness.	It isn't a super important skill to work into your routine, but can replace chorusing or reading aloud at higher levels if you're looking for a good way to get pronunciation and speaking practice in. It's especially useful if you decide to adopt a "language parent" and want to practice speaking like they do.	Certain equipment makes shadowing easier to do, but most people don't have a professional microphone at home. The other common issue is that chorusing is hard to do, even in your native language! Don't feel bad if it's really hard for you.	To start shadowing, you're going to need a few things (plus some that are optional).⏎Audio (from a single speaker) that you're able to follow along with, headphones, and a quiet space. Optionally, a microphone with a direct monitor is very useful (that's a microphone where you can hear your own voice in the headphones in real time).	Now it's time to shadow! Your goal is to follow along with the audio as closely as possible.⏎1. Start the audio and listen for a few seconds to get into the groove⏎2. Start speaking along with the audio, matching the pace and tone of voice⏎3. When you lose your place, take a breath and start again⏎⏎If you have a microphone with direct monitor, being able to listen to yourself and the audio is very helpful for hearing how you sound.	Shadowing is a difficult skill, which takes practice to get good at, so don't be upset if it's really hard at the beginning. Keep at it and you'll improve quickly. If you want to build up to shadowing, try Chorusing! It's a little easier to do (but harder to set up), and just as useful.	6;7	https://youtu.be/SGQK4BHufiQ	https://youtu.be/ZqqLmLezFgE	Technique	Listening, Speaking	Listening, Speaking	Freeflow		Speaking Practice;Interactive Listening						Activities
40202	TYPING_PRACTICE	Typing practice	- Keyboard	Practicing using the keyboard of your target language.	Typing is a valuable skill, but it often doesn't carry over to other languages. Many have different layouts or input methods. Learning how to type in your target language makes it much easier to look up words, chat, or practice writing.	Make looking up words easier;Opens the world of online communication;Can be pretty fun :)	Specific instructions are hard to give since every language is going to be a slightly different scenario, but here are some general tips.	Learning to type isn't important for many languages, but is of massive importance for others! If you're learning a language with a vastly different keyboard layout, doing some kind of typing practice is going to make your whole learning experience smoother. You don't need to do very much practice or study to have a massive benefit when looking up words, communicating with tutors or searching for content.	Learning to type with a new keyboard layout that is different to the physical keyboard you have means you'll need to memorize any differences on the keyboard. This can be especially frustrating for that one time a week you need to type the ^ character. Switching back and forth between your "native" keyboard and target language one helps reduce this frustration. But so does practice.	You'll need to start by choosing how you're going to type. On a mobile phone? A keyboard? Depending on the language, there might be a big difference! You'll then need to set up your computer or phone to have that keyboard available. On mobile devices, it's usually called "Keyboards" and you can install the one you want to use. On computers, it might be called "Keyboards" or "Input method." There is more to choose from on a computer. If the language is slightly different from your native one, there might be an "international" version of your normal keyboard layout, which gives you access to the new characters of other languages. Otherwise, you can choose the keyboard layout from a target language-speaking country. Your physical keyboard might not match (which can feel weird), but with practice, you can learn to type without looking anyway. If you're dedicated and have access, you could even look into buying a second keyboard with that exact layout.	Once you know what keyboard/layout you're using, it's time to start practicing! https://monkeytype.com/ is a great site to practice on since there are lots of languages you can choose from (open the settings and scroll down a bit), or enter your own text to practice with. You'll start slow, but at first, you just want to train your fingers to find the right keys.	Practice for 10–20 minutes per day and you'll see your WPM improve quickly.	1;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/e37h2COBk8o	https://youtu.be/qLSOQtkfax8	Technique	Writing, Study	Writing, Study	Priming		Writing Practice			Monkeytype			Activities
60203	GRAMMAR_STUDY	Grammar Study	- Grammar priming⏎- Textbook	Studying the grammar of your target language.	Learning the grammar of a language can be overwhelming! This category is a catch-all bucket for any kind of grammar study you're doing, such as reading a grammar textbook, doing practice exercises, watching explainer videos or whatever else you can think of.	Understand sentences more easily;Unlock nuance hidden in grammar patterns;Improve the accuracy of your output	There are many different ways to study the grammar of a new language. Typically, you'll find the best resources from long-time teachers of those languages who have helped hundreds of students. Do some searching for apps, websites or even books that teach grammar, try a few of them out, then pick the one that works for you.	Grammar study changes drastically throughout your learning journey.⏎⏎As a beginner, you want to learn just enough to understand. But keep it very limited and certainly don't do any drills. There's time to dive deep once you understand most sentences.⏎⏎In the intermediate stages, it's a good idea to focus on more detailed or deep aspects of grammar. Why does this mean that? It's much easier to learn the grammar after you already understand the language.⏎⏎And when you're outputting, it's a good idea to start more deeply learning specific rules, practicing with drills and looking at (some) charts. Explicitly learning the grammar helps you to use it more naturally when speaking and writing.	Don't overdo it! The traditional grammar translation methods of language learning made us all think that grammar was critical to learning a new language! It's important, but not in the beginning. Vocabulary and interactive immersion are much more important to progressing quickly.⏎⏎A frequent complaint is that "this grammar doesn't make sense!" If that happens to you, move on from it. Studying it more is only likely to make your head hurt. When you understand more intuitivly what a grammar construction means, it's much (much) easier to learn. Skipping it for now doesn't mean you're ignoring it forever.	Good grammar resources help you to understand the grammar, rather than trying to make you memorize rules. Depending on where you are in your language learning journey, you'll need different amounts of detail. As a beginner, you want just enough to break down sentences and understand what's happening. When you're intermediate, learning the nuances that grammar brings is helpful and as an advanced learner, learning to properly use the grammar is important.	Learning and memorizing grammar is only the beginning. If you hope to truly learn and understand it, you'll need to actually see it and understand it in your immersion.	Don't overdo it! Just 10–15 minutes per day is enough to help you on your way. Too much is likely going to overwhelm you and make it difficult to use all the knowledge. There's only so much you can absorb in a day. The grammar isn't going anywhere, you have plenty of time to figure it out.⏎⏎And don't neglect vocab study! Words are (usually) more important for making progress!	1;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/WUqK7Ytnngg	https://youtu.be/tNvLrpgv2ao	Category	Study	Study	Priming	#N/A							Activities
30102	SENTENCE_MINING_AUDIO	Sentence Mining (While Listening)	- Mining⏎- Card creation⏎- Migaku⏎- Anki	Like normal sentence mining but with the subtitles hidden most of the time.	Sentence mining means saving words or phrases from target-language content to study later. It's especially powerful with videos, shows, or movies since you learn words in context, build stronger connections, and can include audio or images to make reviews more engaging.	Expand your abilities in the language;Train your ear to parse the language;Quickly verify and learn new things;Solidify knowledge learned from priming;Make personalized vocab cards to learn from	Sentence mining is a very powerful technique for understanding more of the language and learning more vocabulary. Once you get everything set up and learn the workflow, it might become your favorite activity.	Sentence mining (listening only) is the best way to find new vocabulary to learn. It's a fantastic form of interactive immersion, which will help you to improve your listening. It's great for learning new words, reviewing ones you've already learned, and practicing understanding sentences and following a story.	Interactive immersion in general can be intense and difficult. It might feel like your brain is melting. This is normal! But you should be prepared for it. Don't plan to do interactive immersion when you're exhausted after a long day. Find when you have the most learning energy and do it then.	You'll first need to set up tools in order to sentence mine.	Once you've done that, here's how to do the technique:⏎⏎Whenever you hear an interesting word or can't understand a sentence, pause the video, repeat the section a few times to give yourself another chance, then turn on subtitles and look up a few words. If the sentence has more than 3–4 words you don't know, feel free to move on. The goal isn't to understand every sentence. You want to focus on the low hanging fruit.⏎⏎The lower your level in the language, the more you'll pause. That's okay. It might take you 5× the length of the content to actually get through it. But you're learning, that's the point.⏎⏎Anyway, whenever you come across a sentence that has only 1 or 2 new words in it, this is a great time to mine! You don't want to mine sentences that have 5–6 new things in them. That sentence is too complicated for now. You'll be able to understand it with time.⏎⏎When you've found a good sentence, use the tool to mine the sentence! This usually involves selecting the sentence and pressing a button or using a keyboard shortcut. Great job! You just mined a sentence.⏎⏎Many sentence mining tools have "auto-pause" features, which automatically pause after each subtitle line, giving you time to look up words. We recommend you use this since it forces you to focus more on understanding, rather than just zoning out and watching the pretty colors go by.⏎⏎It's also a good idea to rewatch a scene or a few lines after you successfully understand, since that gives your brain a good chance to really understand it, in real time.⏎⏎The core "loop" of sentence mining is this:⏎- You watch a sentence/line, focusing on hearing the words⏎- When you miss something, listen to it a few more times⏎- Pause, enable subtitles and look up 1–2 unknown words with the dictionary⏎- You try to understand what the sentence means⏎- You save the sentence to your flashcards for review later⏎- You rewatch the section to review the spoken version and solidify it in your mind⏎- Turn subtitles back off⏎- Repeat!	After your sentence mining session, you'll have a bunch of new flashcards to study! You should study these during your normal flashcard review time, ideally a day or two after you mined them, so they're still a little fresh in your mind.⏎⏎Tip: It's very easy to mine a TON of cards! Way more than you need or can study at the time. For this reason, we recommend removing or deleting cards that you don't need. For example, if you're reviewing new words and you realize that one of the words is very niche or the card is a bit broken, delete that card! If that word is important, it'll come up again and you can mine it then.⏎⏎Same goes for if you have too many new cards. If you realize that you're not reviewing new cards you recently made (since you created a large backlog), feel free to delete some of the older ones. It's better to review the words that are more relevant to the content you're currently immersing in.	3;4;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/v4WcW7okons	na	Technique	Listening, Watching	Listening, Watching	Interactive		Interactive Listening			Migaku;ASBplayer;Kimchi Reader;LingoPie;Yomitan;AnkiConnect			Activities

Language classes are a good supplement, but shouldn't be your main source of exposure. Ideally no more than 20% of your learning time. Stay engaged, bring questions from self-study, and look for class content during immersion.	Be in an environment with other learners and speakers;Confront your weak points in the language;Someone else comes up with the lesson plan	Language classes are a great supplement to your immersion learning! They can be fun and are especially useful for people who need a little external motivation.	Most language classes are still very traditional, with a focus on grammar and speaking. If this is the case for your class, you should be doing a lot of interactive immersion on your own time, as well as additional vocab study. ⏎⏎But even in a more modern language classroom, you're unlikely to be getting nearly enough exposure to the language.⏎⏎Try to keep your classroom time no more than 20% of your total learning time (unless you're doing a 5+ hour/day intensive course).	Don't expect classes to be very effective if you're not also learning on your own! It might feel like going to class is going to give you everything you need, but without self study and immersion you're going to make very slow progress.		1. Sign up for a language class⏎2.

40201	COPYWORK	Copywork	- Copy writing	Copying text into your own notebook, by hand!	This may seem like a strange activity, but it's rewarding. "Copywork" means copying a passage by hand after fully understanding it. Read the text, look up unknown words, then copy it word for word on paper. Try copying a few words at a time, holding the language in your mind is the core of the exercise.	Very low-tech way to do interactive immersion;Train your brain to remember the language more abstractly;Practice handwriting and reading	To do copywork, there are a few steps and some simple materials. Start by getting paper and something to write with, text in your target language (a book works well) and a way to look up new words or phrases.	Copywork is a very solid interactive immersion activity, but isn't required for a successful routine. It is a useful technique to know, though, for times when you don't have access to all your normal tools. Or you might find that you really like doing it! It's a decent for sentence mining and can even replace Anki if you review your notes well!	If you're learning a language with a very different script, you should start with some Handwriting Practice first. But then copywork can be excellent additional practice with real text!	Start by reading a smallish passage or page all the way through. Understand as much as you can. Then, work your way through it again, looking up things you don't know. The section you read should make sense.	Now, copy the text onto your paper or notebook. The goal is to copy entire sentences at a time, so you don't have to constantly look back at the page. This is hard, so start smaller (just a few words at a time). When you make mistakes, just cross them out and write it again.⏎⏎You'll need to find your own groove for this, since everyone is a little different. Continue to copy until you have the entire section written in your own hand. Reread the section you wrote, checking for mistakes.	And optionally, you can write down all the words you didn't know from the passage and their meanings. This can help reinforce their meaning in your mind.⏎⏎Once you've done that passage, continue on! Copying just a single passage can take a long time, so don't worry about going slow, this mental exercise is the whole point.	2;5	https://youtu.be/EP8SxYh44ZQ	na	Technique	Reading, Writing	Reading, Writing	Interactive		Interactive Reading						Activities
50102	SPEAKING_WITH_PARTNER	Speaking with partner	- Conversation⏎- Tutor⏎- Talk⏎- Chat⏎- Friend⏎- Meetup⏎- Teacher	Having a conversation with someone.	Have you ever talked to someone? Well, that's what this activity is for! It can be any kind of conversation, from chatting with a friend over coffee or taking a conversation class online. You both should be speaking in your target language, however. If you want to practice crosstalk, there's a different activity for that.	Practice speaking with immediate feedback;Make friends while using the language	In order to have a conversation, you should say something, then wait for the other person to respond. Listen to what they have to say, then say something else!⏎⏎I'm just kidding, I'm sure you know what a conversation is. But I do have a few tips (in the tips section) for having conversations in your target language.	When you're working on your speaking (and output in general), you should aim to have a lot of conversations. Ideally, 3 or 4 per week for at least 45 minutes each. Conversations are the best way to get speaking practice and help you develop relationships with native speakers.	Speaking with people can be nerve-racking! If you feel nervous about speaking with someone, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you've already come so far. All of us language learners are right there with you!			- Ask questions! Especially when you're a beginner, letting the other person lead the conversation can be very helpful⏎- Don't pretend you understood something if you didn't, politely ask them to say something again or ask them what a word means, it's a learning opportunity⏎- Most native speakers aren't used to talking to learners, so don't expect them to be! Don't ask them to correct your mistakes or for language advice. It's best to find a tutor for that since they have experience with other learners⏎- In a similar vein, don't expect them to understand you perfectly. Natives are accustomed to speaking with other natives, who say things in a way they expect. If someone doesn't understand you, don't worry about it and try again!⏎- If you can't find a tutor or can't pay for classes, speaking with AI tutors can be a decent, which are likely to keep getting better. But still try to find real natives to talk to!	4;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/tO2x6gWpigE	na	Category	Speaking	Speaking	Freeflow	Speaking with a Group; Hangout							Activities
20202	CHARACTER_STUDY	Character Study	- Hanzi⏎- Hanja⏎- Kanji⏎- Characters⏎- Chinese characters	Learning a character (Kanji or Hanzi) writing system.	When learning a language with characters, your brain needs time to adapt. This activity focuses on learning characters and building techniques to remember and read them. After a few hundred, your brain adjusts and active character study becomes less necessary, though you'll still keep learning new words as part of vocabulary study.	Learn to read by looking at little pictures;Unlock the world of written texts in several related languages;Important if you want to be considered literate	The best tutorial for how to do this is to read our Character Primer: https://refold.link/character-primer⏎⏎It goes into better depth on how to learn characters effectively.	Once you've learned to read the phonetic writing system well (such as Kana or Pinyin), you should turn your attention to characters. If you're not able to fluidly read that writing system yet, keep working on it. It's more important right now and much quicker.⏎⏎It's going to take hundreds of hours and thousands of characters before your brain truly gets used to them, but that's why it's important to start now. You shouldn't be doing that much explicit character study, only enough to become familiar with how they work and how to learn them. Once you're there, reading a lot and doing vocab study will be how you learn new characters.	There's more depth in our character primer, but the most common issue people face with characer learning is trying to memorize the character rather than the word itself.⏎⏎A character is only a part of a whole word. Words are made up of: meaning, pronunciation, character, semantic nuance, etc. Lots of things! Beginner learners will try to specifically memorize the relationship between a charater and the meaning. Or the character and the pronunciation rather than learning the character as part of the whole word.⏎⏎Words come before characters. This is one of the reasons we recommend starting with phonetic writing systems first. That way, you can already learn a few hundred words, then start to connect characters to those words. It's a lot easier this way (and more like how native speakers do it as children).		https://refold.link/character-primer		1;2	https://youtu.be/buVw-QuzH_4	na	Category	Study	Study	Priming	#N/A							Activities
60201	SOUND_STUDY	Sound study	- Sound priming⏎- Audio priming⏎- Sound preparation⏎- Audio preparation⏎- Phonology study	Learning about the sounds used in your target language.	Your native language likely has different sounds than your target one. While there may be some overlap, many sounds will be new to your ears. Studying your target language's phonology (even briefly) can greatly boost listening, awareness, and accent.	Train your ears to hear new sounds;Positive impact on your listening and future accent;Effective in small amounts	There are many different ways to study a new language's sounds. Typically, you'll find the best resources from long-time teachers of those languages who have helped hundreds of students. They frequently make YouTube videos going over it. Some other good places to look are Fluent Forever videos or even checking out the language's Wikipedia article.	Doing a bit of sound study at the beginning of your learning goes a long way. But don't worry about pronunciation or getting everything exactly right. When you're working on your listening, it's a much better time to dive into the sounds and make sure you have everything right in your head. And remember, a little sound study goes a long way!	Our brains literally learn to ignore sounds that aren't important for our native language. This means that there may be sounds you cannot hear the difference between. Trust the resources over your own ears and with time, you'll learn to distinguish them.⏎⏎Age plays a role in learning new sounds. It doesn't mean you're doomed to never being able to hear the sounds of your target language if you're over 40, but it does mean you'll need to pay special attention and do more practice than a teenager (damn kids).	The resource that you use isn't a critical decision point, you just need the basics, then lots of practice, which will come during your immersion.	Doing 10–20 minutes of learning the sounds for a few days can really help your listening (and speaking) down the line!	A few tips for sound study:⏎- If you can't hear the difference between two sounds that are different, that's normal! Try your best to hear it, but it's going to take time to effectively hear the difference⏎- Trainers that let you compare sounds side by side can be really useful⏎- The way the language writes the sounds might be a little arbitrary! So don't trust the writing system⏎- You might come across the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), which is a way to write down sounds exactly. You don't need to memorize it for it to be useful. But when you see a different symbol used for something, that means it's a different sound!⏎- In the beginning, don't worry about being able to pronounce the sounds (unless you're in the Speaking stage). As long as you can hear it, you'll eventually be able to say it	1;3;4	https://youtu.be/ejEtZzvFpxw	na	Category	Study	Study	Priming	Ear training	Ear Training						Activities
30202	SUBVOCAL_SHADOWING	Subvocal Shadowing	- Shadowing⏎- Echoing⏎- Parroting⏎- Mimicking⏎- Chorusing	Speaking inside your head, along with audio or while reading.	This is primarily a focus tool. When you're really struggling to read something or listen, reading aloud/repeating the words inside your head can help you snap your focus back to the content. This activity doesn't have any particular merit beyond improving your focus on the target language.	Excellent focus tool for when you're struggling to pay attention	Subvocal shadowing is a focus tool which can be done during basically any immersion activity. If you find your focus wandering, try doing this activity to bring your focus back to the language!	Knowing how to do subvocal shadowing and what it's useful for is very helpful for your learning routine. But it's not a critical activity that you should plan to do. It's an addition to other immersion activities, such as freeflow listening or reading.			If you're reading something, slow down and start to "think" the words, like you're saying them inside your head. This should snap your focus back to the content.⏎⏎Similar if you're listening, repeat after what the person is saying, but inside your head. This should help you tune back into the content, especially if it's a little too difficult.⏎⏎Don't worry about your accent or "in-head pronunciation." That's not the point of this activity.⏎⏎When you have your focus back on the content, you can stop subvocal shadowing and try to focus on the content again.		1;2;3;4;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/25nDOFYGu70	na	Category	Reading, Listening, Watching	Reading, Listening, Watching	Freeflow	#N/A							Activities
20106	READING_ALOUD_CORRECTED	Corrected Reading Aloud		Reading aloud from a text and receiving corrections from a native.	This is an excellent activity for working on your pronunciation and naturalness when speaking. Getting live feedback from a teacher is incredibly valuable.	Practice pronunciation and speaking rhythm;Immediately recognize and improve mistakes	Corrected reading aloud is an excellent way to spend a tutoring session if you're looking to get detailed and immediate feedback on the way that you speak. It's much easier to focus on pronunciation and speaking rhythm when you don't also have to come up with all the words on your own. And the feedback from the tutor allows you to catch and fix mistakes/unnaturalness very quickly.	This is an activity best done toward the beginning of your speaking journey. It trains the fundamental skills of speaking aloud, pronunciation and other things, but doesn't help you improve the conversion of thoughts to speech. But when you need to work on those fundamental skills, it's an excellent activity to work into your routine. ⏎⏎It can also be a great activity to do if you have a lot of tutoring sessions that you don't know what to do with. Some platforms have good deals if you buy dozens of lessons or if you do something every day for a month. If you get tired of whatever the teachers bring to class, corrected reading aloud is a great thing to do instead.	The most common issue is that your teacher or tutor doesn't understand what you're trying to focus on. But if you're clear that you want them to give you feedback on how to sound more natural when you're reading, they should be able to help you. Some teachers are better at this than others.⏎⏎It's also easy to overcorrect your speaking and end up sounding too much like a radio presentor or narrator. Finding a balance between naturalness and clarity is key.	To do corrected reading aloud, you'll need to find a text to read from. Any text can work, but you can choose different kinds of texts depending on what kind of thing you want to practice. For example, Wikipedia articles might have lots of numbers, dates or names. A new article will have more relevant vocabulary. A play or subtitles will be more based on dialogue. Pick the kind of text that works best for your goals!⏎⏎You'll also want to make sure you have a decent microphone (unless you're in person) so that your teacher can hear you well.⏎⏎And finally, instruct your teacher on what kind of feedback you want. Tell them something like this: "I'm going to read a sentence or two, then we're going to stop and I want you to comment on parts of the sentence that sounded unnatural. We'll work on those parts, then I'll read it again. I want you to specifically comment on the clarity of my pronunciation, the flow and rhythm of how I speak and anything else that sound off to your native ears."	Now you're ready to start reading! ⏎⏎Read aloud the first sentence (or two if they're short). If you need to pause or read ahead, take your time.⏎⏎Once you've read it, stop and your teacher should jump in to point out some areas where it sounded unnatural. Take their feedback and try it. If it's a pronunciation, say the word slowly and practice the sounds. If it's about the rhythm, ask them to repeat it for you. It's an exploratory process.⏎⏎Then, when you're ready, try reading the section again.	If you're more comfortable with reading aloud, you can do more than just a sentence or two! ⏎⏎If you're in the writing phase, you can also bring your own writing and read that aloud! They can also give you corrections on errors you made in your writing so you can learn from that. This "corrected reading your writing aloud" is a fantastic way to improve many different output skills at the same time.	4;5	https://youtu.be/VTSgBag2Gr8	na	Technique	Speaking, Pronunciation	Speaking, Pronunciation	Interactive								Activities
30105	LOW_ATTENTION_LISTENING	Half-attention Listening	- Passive listening⏎- Passive input⏎- Background input⏎- Background listening⏎- Low attention	Listening to audio with partial focus, maybe while doing chores or walking.	Sometimes you can only pay half attention to your listening, like if you're cooking, cleaning or walking.	Get a lot of exposure to the language;Train your brain to understand meaning effortlessly;Fill otherwise empty time	There are many times in your day where you need to do something that only takes a bit of your attention. And with the right language learning content, that can become valuable listening time! Half-attention listening isn't as effective as fully paying attention, but can still be great to supplement you're more active immersion. Especially at higher levels, where you don't need to pay as much attention to understand everything.	When you're able to listen and understand content without too much effort, adding in more half-attention listening can increase the amount of time you spend with your target language. It's best done at higher levels when you can follow along with podcasts or audiobooks. Lower level learners can also get a decent amount out of half-attention listening by using easier content (slow podcasts made for learners, audiobooks they're very familiar with or relistening to things that were done with more active immersion).	The biggest problem with half-attention listening is that it's too easy to fit into your day. Many people can do several hours of half-attention listening per day (at the gym, on your commute, at work (depending on your job), etc). But half-attention listening isn't nearly as effective as even full attention freeflow immersion. So it can inflate your daily hours, without actually providing much benefit.⏎⏎Another common mistake is counting Background Listening as Half-attention Listening. In order for something to be considered half-attention, you should be able to summarize what's going on. If it's just becoming sound in your ears and you understand maybe 25%, it's Background Listening.⏎⏎The final common issue is with freeflow in general. Many people do lots of freeflow and stop doing any interactive immersion. This will halt your progress, or slow it to a crawl. 	The only real set up there is for half-attention listening is to find audio. Audiobooks and podcasts are the most common and easiest, but you can also use YouTube videos or even look into creating "Condensed Audio" from a movie or TV show.⏎⏎Having some nice earbuds is a good plus, especially if you're planning on doing lots of half-attention listening.		If you want to do half-attention listening while you're still at a fairly low level, try relistening to audiobooks you know well, at a slightly lower speed!	4;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/f_x-VnKag7g	na	Technique	Listening	Listening	Freeflow		Freeflow Listening						Activities

Once you get everything set up and learn the workflow, it might become your favorite activity.	Sentence mining (while reading) is the best way to find new vocabulary to learn in the advanced stages. It's a fantastic form of interactive immersion, which should make up a solid chunk your learning time. It's great for learning new words, reviewing ones you've already learned, and immersing yourself in stories (or whatever kind of written texts interest you).	Reading is a skill that you might need to develop, especially if you haven't done much pure reading in your target language yet. ⏎⏎Setting up tools to easily read and save words can also be a pain, if you don't already have a workflow set up. But thankfully, there are many great readers for language learners which make this easier.	You'll first need to set up tools in order to sentence mine.	Once you've done that, here's how to do the technique:⏎⏎While you're reading, look out for new words or sentences you don't understand. Depending on your level, this might happen every sentence or every paragraph. And eventually only a few times per page!⏎⏎Look up new words you don't know so that you can understand what the text says. But for sentence mining, you're on the lookout for sentences that have just one (or maybe two) unknow words. These are the sentences you want to save.⏎⏎Whenever you come across a good sentence like that, save it to your flashcards! ⏎⏎After your sentence mining session, you'll have a bunch of new flashcards to study! You should study these during your normal flashcard review time, ideally a day or two after you mined them, so they're still a little fresh in your mind.	Tip: It's very easy to mine a TON of cards! Way more than you need or can study at the time. For this reason, we recommend removing or deleting cards that you don't need. For example, if you're reviewing new words and you realize that one of the words is very niche or the card is a bit broken, delete that card! If that word is important, it'll come up again and you can mine it then.⏎⏎Same goes for if you have too many new cards. If you realize that you're not reviewing new cards you recently made (since you created a large backlog), feel free to delete some of the older ones. It's better to review the words that are more relevant to the content you're currently immersing in.⏎⏎The cards that you mine from text only won't have audio or images, which can make them feel a bit boring. This isn't an issue, but if you'd like to add audio to your cards in bulk, HyperTTS for Anki is an excellent add-on which can generate high quality audio for all of your mined cards.	2;5;6;7	https://youtu.be/qB0PGi5ah40	https://youtu.be/yKFfh-LYFqI	Technique	Reading	Reading	Interactive		Interactive Reading			Kimchi Reader;Yomitan;AnkiConnect;Lute;ReadLang			Activities
30106	INTENSIVE_LISTENING	Intensive Listening	- Interactive listening⏎- Listening w/ Lookups⏎- Corrected Listening	Using tools to listen closely and fully understand audio.	Listening to something without the aid of any text (includes TV shows, podcasts, audiobooks, etc.), but doing your best to understand as much as possible by replaying sections you find difficult and verifying what was said from the subtitles.	Train your ears to hear things you know;Adapt your listening to real speech;Uncover new parts of the spoken language	Intensive listening is a style of Interactive Listening where you relisten to things and use tools to understand your listening immersion more than you would without stopping, pausing or relistening to things.	When you're working on improving your listening, intensive listening is a fantastic activity to do. It's similar to Listen Looping and Sentence Mining (while listening). It's best to incorporate into your routine when you need to improve your listening, but also want to engage with media in the target language.	Differentiating intensive listening with interactive listening is hard. The names are just so similar. Intensive listening is a specific activity you do while immersing in audio based content. Interactive listening, however, is the broader category of activities. Intensive listening is a type of interactive listening.⏎⏎The other trouble is that intensive listening is... intense! It takes a lot of focus and brain power. So don't try to do it when you're tired. Plan to do it when you have the most energy.	You'll need to set up some kind of tool for navigating the media you're using. The setup for Sentence Mining works great for intensive listening, as well. You just won't need the flashcard part.⏎⏎You'll also need audio visual content (like a TV show, movie or YouTube video) which has subtitles. The subtitles will be OFF during your immersion, but they're still helpful for navigating and relistening to lines. Most video players use 10 or 5 second skipping, rather than navigating by dialogue lines. ⏎⏎When you have your subtitles loaded and hidden from view, you're ready to start intensive listening.	This is the general process of intensive listening.⏎⏎1. Listen to a line in the media and pause (enable autopause to pause for you)⏎2. Did you understand what was said and meant? If you got everything, play and move on⏎3. If you didn't, press the key to relisten to the line and try to hear it again. Relisten up to 3 times before enabling subtitles and checking what was said⏎4. Look up any new words that you don't know the meaning of⏎5. If you knew all the words, but couldn't hear what was said, relisten again but with the subtitles enabled until you can piece out the words from the audio⏎6. Disable subtitles and play the line again, then move on⏎⏎This process can be very slow, especially when you're listening is still developing! As you get better and faster, you won't need to relisten to most lines, just some here and there. ⏎⏎Note about autopause: Many people find it annoying as it slows you down! But that's kind of the point. It forces you to think about every phrase and sentence and see if you actually understood. Once you understand over 50% of the lines without needing to reveal subtitles, you can turn off autopause. But before that point, it's really helpful.	This process is very similar to Sentence Mining (while Listening) but doesn't have the part where you save new words. If you want to start doing that, check out that activity!	3;4;5	https://youtu.be/QG571SD1rb0	na	Technique	Listening	Listening	Interactive		Interactive Listening						Activities
20102	INTERLINEAR_READING	Interlinear reading	- TL text & NL text⏎- Bilingual⏎- Translated	Reading a text with both your target language and native language.	An interlinear text has alternating lines in the target language and a language you easily understand. It allows you to easily and quickly check your understanding of something.	Enjoy reading without any tools;Great way to start extensively reading	Interlinear texts have existed for quite a while and can be great for reading. If they interest you. Not everyone enjoys using interlinear texts and might prefer Interactive Reading instead.	Depending on the kind of interlinear text you have, it can be a good thing to incorporate into a routine early or later! If the text is a graded reader, meant for beginners, you can start from the very first day and use the translation to breakdown what the text in the target language says. Or if you can find an interlinear text for a more advanced novel (or use an online tool to create it), it can be a great way to start practicing reading "adult level material."⏎⏎However, interlinear reading is not required to have a good routine.	Finding or creating interlinear texts can be difficult for many languages. If you can't find anything, Interactive Reading or reading with a reader tool will be just as effective for your language learning.⏎⏎It can also become too easy to rely on the native language text. If you find that you're not really reading the target language and instantly checking the translation, you're robbing your brain of valuable learning time!				1;2;4;5;6	na	na	Technique	Reading	Reading	Freeflow		Freeflow Reading						Activities

While video games are usually not very good language learning material, playing them can help you learn some words or feel more connected to the language.	Fun (if you like video games);Give you things to talk to natives about;Convert non-language learning time into something slightly productive	Turning a video game into your target language isn't too difficult. There are usually 3 levels of translations: interface, subtitles, full dub. Ideally, you're playing a story heavy game with everything dubbed and subbed in the target language.	Playing video games shouldn't really be considered as part of your language learning routine, unless you're playing visual novels, which are basically just books.⏎⏎However, video games can be a great addition to a routine in a few ways:⏎1. It can give you a niche interest to immerse in on YouTube. Watching someone else play the game and narrarate what they're doing is great immersion content!⏎2. You can find groups of native speakers who like that game and join in! Playing games with other people is an excellent way to practice listening and speaking and making friends. This wouldn't be considered "Video Games," though.						na	na	Category				#N/A							Activities

It's much more useful if you live in a country that uses the language, since it's more likely to come up. ⏎⏎If the language's writing system is quite similar to your native one, you don't need to practice much, since most things are the same. However, if you're learning an entirely new script, doing some handwriting practice throughout your learning journey is a good idea as it helps you be a more well rounded user of the language.	If you want to learn how to write characters, you have a lot of practice to do! But luckily character based calligraphy has been around for thousands of years. There are lots of good courses out there.	There are many different methods for learning how to handwrite. Finding a course specifically for your target language will make the process easier. Ideally, find a course in the target language so that you get more input! But a simple online guide works just as well.⏎⏎Getting a dedicated notebook can also be really nice since you can see your progress over time and you always know where you're going to practice your handwriting.⏎⏎Once you're ready, 10-15 minutes per day is more than enough to make great progress!		If you're learning the language of your partner or family, writing them handwritten notes is a good way to practice, and will probably make their day.	1;2;5;7	na	na	Technique	Writing	Writing	Priming								Activities

50203	PHRASE_MEMORIZATION	Phrase memorization	- Phrase study⏎- Phrase book⏎- Language Hacking	Memorizing any text in your target language.	Memorizing texts (which can be anything) can be a great way to practice many different skills required for speaking and writing. Constant repetition of correct forms can help you form sentences, but also practice pronunciation and rhythm.	Repeatedly use correct forms;Practice pronunciation and rhythm;Impress natives with random bits of memorized text	Memorizing texts is a great way to train various aspects of the target language at the same time. It's most useful for people who are trying to improve their output, since they can memorize texts that target their weak points and learn from them.	When you're trying to work on your accuracy when speaking or writing in the target language, memorizing texts or phrases can help a lot! Memorizing phrases can allow you to "fake" an instinct and use the correct language without needing to overthink anything. The process of memorization also trains your working memory of the language. And when you practice saying the text aloud, you get additional practice with pronunciation, fluidity, rhythm and more!	If you haven't done much memorization before (in any language), you might struggle to remember even short phrases in the target language. Learning to memorize texts accuratly (and relatively quickly) is a skill you will need to develop. Start small and build up to larger passages!	Firstly, you'll need to chose something to memorize. You can start with simple phrases, dialogues, monologues, a text from a book or article, anything! But one of the most powerful things to memorize is a (corrected) text you wrote yourself. That's because you get practice expressing your own ideas, in the target language, which you know are correct. ⏎⏎The only other thing you need is a place to focus and speak aloud, as you review the text.	How to memorize something:⏎- If you're using a longer text, break it up into smaller chunks⏎- Read through the first chunk or section a few times in your head and then aloud⏎- Look up any words you don't know and ensure you understand what you're saying⏎- Practice any words that have difficult pronunciation or transitions between words⏎- Read aloud the chunk/phrase a few more times, then attempt to do it without looking⏎- Keep repeating it a few times, only looking when you must⏎- Once you're able to do the passage a few times without looking at all, move on⏎- Continue memorizing other chunks for a while, then repeat all of them. The process should be smoother, since you already memorized several, but you'll likely to have forgotten them⏎- Continue jumping between phrases or chunks and trying to connect them together until you feel confident⏎- WAIT A FEW HOURS (or till the next day) to let the phrases settle in your brain. Then return to them again to continue practicing	Getting good at memorizing things takes practice and you will need to develop your own techniques and preferences. The walkthrough above is meant to serve as a starting place.⏎⏎One of the best things you can do is memorize your own (corrected) writing since you practice using phrases and ideas that you wanted to express. Combining Unassisted Writing, Writing Analysis, Corrected Writing, and Phrase Memorization will help you develop a lot of skills that make you a better speaker and writer in your target language.	5;6;7	na	na	Technique	Reading, Speaking, Study	Reading, Speaking, Study	Interactive								Activities

If you have a favorite language app to learn vocabulary or grammar points, track the time you spend with the app under this category.	Learn new words and grammar patterns to recognize in your immersion	If you have a favorite language learning app that doesn't seem to neatly fit into any of the other categories, you can track it under this one. There no specific rules about what counts as a language learning app, so that judgement is up to you.	How apps fit into your learning greatly vary depending on the app in question and what it does. If it's best for learning vocabulary, you might want to track it under Vocab Study. If it helps you review grammar then Grammar Study. ⏎⏎But if it's a little bit of everything and it's unclear exactly how it's helping you, you shouldn't spend too much time on the app. Immersion is a much better way to spend your time.	Many people use apps too much and rely on them too much! There is no phone app which can bring you from zero to fluency. You must use a wide range of tools if you want to become fluent.⏎⏎The biggest trap people fall into with apps is that many of them are "gamified," which means they might be fun or addictive. Many of the most popular apps use aggressive gamification to get users hooked on their game, even though it's not providing any real language learning benefit. The most common example of this is "streaks." If you have a large streak in a language learning game, but only maintain it... because you like the number to be large, break that streak. That game is taking advantage of your attention. Put that energy and few minutes of focus toward something more beneficial.				1;2	na	na	Category	Study	Study	Priming	#N/A	Vocab Study			Duolingo			Activities

Preparing for an official language test or exam (such as the B2 or N1) often requires specific study for that test. Track that time in this category!	Learn the structure of the test;Improve your weak points the test is likely to focus on;Pass tests that are higher than your real ability	Taking a test in your target language is often required for something like school, work or immigration. But it can also be a great standardized marker of your progress in the language! But preparing for a test isn't like normal immersion learning. There are different things you need to keep in mind and focus on.	Unless you need to pass a test for something, we generally don't recommend devoting time and energy to it until you're already fairly comfortable and fluent in the language. But take into account your own personal circumstances and then decide when it's right for you to take the test. ⏎⏎Until about the intermediate stages, your focus should be on learning to understand the language, not anything test specific. Being able to understand and use the language is a very large part of the test, after all. But once you reach an intermediate level in reading, writing, listening and speaking, it does become very beneficial to specifically study for the test you're going to take. ⏎⏎This means reducing your "general" language learning time or adding on test prep as more time. 	Taking time to study for a test will (probably) take away from your immersion time! This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but can slow down your progress, so keep that in mind.⏎⏎The other issue is that studying for a test can feel a lot like doing math homework. It's helpful if you want to get a good score, though!	The best thing you can do is find a course or guide on exactly how to take the test and how to pass the level you're aiming for. Each language has a slightly different test and slightly different requirements. They also change fairly frequently, so finding a fairly up to date course with good reviews is worth it.⏎⏎You should also search out people who've taken (and passed) the test you're aiming for! Hearing their personal experience, especially if they're an immersion learner, can be incredibly valuable test prep.⏎⏎There are also many tutors online who specialize in test prep. Scheduling a few lessons with them (even if they're expensive) can be well worth the investment.⏎⏎The final recommendation we have is to look for (and take) practice tests! They may not be exactly like the official version, but getting some real life practice is incredibly valuable and means that you aren't going into the real test without trying to do it.			5;6;7	na	na	Category	Study	Study	Priming	#N/A							Activities

We don't recommend you track background listening at all, as it can cause you to feel like you're putting in a lot more effort than you are. Background listening shows no evidence for improving your language skills. There's a little evidence that a few dozen hours can help your brain tune into the language, but that's it.

10104	NOTICING_GAME	Noticing Game		Focusing on noticing, rather than understanding.	As a beginner, understanding the language is nearly impossible—which makes it hard to focus. That's why we play the Noticing Game! Instead of aiming to understand, your goal is simply to notice things: full words, interesting sounds, repeated phrases—anything that stands out.	Train your brain to focus on the language;Strengthen things you learn from priming;More fun than not understanding	The Noticing Game is a technique you can use as a beginner (or intermediate) when you aren't able to understand content in the target language. Instead of trying to understand the content, as you would do in a language you're good at, you're just trying to notice things. Anything! This helps you stay focused on the content and learn from it, rather than getting bored or frustrated.	As a beginner, the Noticing Game is critical to being able to immerse in content. When you only know a few hundred words, how are you supposed to actually understand anything? But as you start to learn more words, you should rely on the Noticing Game less and less, and start doing interactive immersion.	The biggest issue learners face is that the Noticing Game feels weird to do. Most adults are used to understanding everything they come across. This discomfort is why the Noticing Game is so important. It helps you stay focused on the language, so that you can learn, even when you understand so little.	The Noticing Game can be played with any kind of content. You don't need any special materials, but if you find it helpful, you can use a list of words to give you things to look for. You can take a list of words you learned in Vocab Study, make yourself a little Bingo Card with the words or any sort of tool to help you notice things.	To actually "play," all you need to do is focus on finding things! The easiest thing to notice are words you've been learning. Other things to notice might be recurring grammar patterns (maybe many words end in the same few letters, or people end sentences with a specific word), or words that look very similar to something you know in another language (cognates).⏎⏎Anything can be noticed. If you find your focus wandering, that's normal. Just remind yourself that you should be noticing things and continue with the content.	When you feel like you're able to do the Noticing Game and want to level up, check out the Noticing Game with Confirmation.	1;2;3	https://youtu.be/hD8qcvwfVSw	https://youtu.be/_x778tDHlGU	Technique	Reading, Listening, Watching	Reading, Listening, Watching	Freeflow		Freeflow Reading + Listening						Activities
20108	NOTICING_GAME_CONF	Noticing Game with confirmation		Noticing things in the language, then checking your observations.	As a beginner, it's hard to understand anything—so instead, play the Noticing Game! Focus on spotting full words, interesting sounds, or repeated phrases.⏎⏎Then, confirm what you noticed. Look up words, explore sounds, and build on your observations. This deepens your knowledge—and soon, you'll start understanding more.	Train yourself to do interactive immersion;Solidify things you learn from priming;Expand your knowledge;More fun than not understanding	The Noticing Game with Confirmation is a technique you can use as a beginner (or intermediate) when you aren't able to understand content in the target language. Instead of trying to understand the content, as you would do in a language you're good at, you're just trying to notice things, then guess what it is, and check your work. This simple form of interactive immersion helps you stay focused on the content and learn from it, rather than getting bored or frustrated.	The Noticing Game with Confirmation is the first kind of interactive immersion you can do. It's incredibly helpful for helping you train your brain to do this kind of immersion and start to solidify and expand your understanding of the target language.	Interactive immersion can be tough! Which is part of the reason we recommend this as most people's first kind of interactive immersion. But if you try it and feel like it's pretty difficult, that probably means you're doing it right! It's a brain workout. This means that you shouldn't try to do it when you're exhausted.	The only thing you need (besides some content to immerse in) is some way to do confirmations. The easiest tool would be a dictionary of some kind. But you can use whatever. Dictionary, website, AI Chatbot... You may also find it helpful to have a list of recent words you've learned so that you can have something specific to look for, but that's optional.	To "play" the Noticing Game with Confirmation, you start just like the regular Noticing Game... by looking out for and noticing things! It can be anything, but looking out for words you think are familiar is the easiest way to do it. Other things to notice might be sounds you've learned during Ear Training or a grammar pattern you say during Grammar Study.⏎⏎Once you see something, try to remember what it means or what it does in the language. If you need to pause for this, go ahead. Once you have a guess, check by using your confirmation method! If it's a word, look it up. Were you close? ⏎⏎Being correct doesn't matter yet. All you're trying to do is notice things, then figure out what that thing you noticed is.	When you feel like you've got the Noticing Game with Confirmation down, try moving on to Interactive Reading with Audio! It's a slightly more in depth version of this, which will really help you make progress.	1;2;3	https://youtu.be/MxXl7AtdzMg	https://youtu.be/JKeXWaaFs6M	Technique	Reading, Listening, Watching	Reading, Listening, Watching	Interactive		Interactive Reading + Listening						Activities

Practice speech flow, rhythm and pronunciation;Easier than chorusing;Decent ear training as well	This is an activity half-way between reading aloud and shadowing. If you enjoy reading aloud and want to get into shadowing, this can be a good activity to try in order to bridge the gap.	This activity isn't needed and should only be used if you're trying to get better at shadowing, but struggle without any text to help you along.	For some people, this can be harder than just working on shadowing or uncorrected reading aloud. If you find that this activity isn't very fun or is too frustrating, stop doing it!	You'll need text, matching audio and a quiet place to read aloud. If you can, the entire setup for Shadowing can help you get better at shadowing.	Now it's time to read aloud with audio! Your goal is to follow along with the audio as closely as possible while using the text as support.⏎1. Start the audio and listen and read along for a few seconds to get into the groove⏎2.

You might also be doing things like getting up, breaking off into side conversations, checking your phone or a million other things.⏎⏎If you spend time with a group of people, you can enter that time into this category.					Being a part of a group is really hard! Expect not to understand a lot of what happens, it's normal. And don't be afraid to ask someone to repeat themselves.
